abstract = "We study the problem of designing spoofing signals
to corrupt and mislead the output of a Kalman filter.
Unlike existing works that focus on detection and filtering
algorithms for the observer, we study the problem from the
attackerâ€™s point-of-view. In our model, the attacker can corrupt
the measurements by adding spoofing signals. The attacker
seeks to create a separation between the estimate of the Kalman
filter with and without spoofing signals. We present a number
of results on how to generate such spoofing signals, while
minimizing the signal magnitude. The resulting algorithms are
evaluated through simulations along with theoretical proofs."
