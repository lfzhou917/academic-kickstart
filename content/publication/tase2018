abstract = "This study proposes a distributed model predictive control (MPC) strategy to achieve consensus of sampled-data multi-agent systems with double-integrator dynamics. On the basis of the error of state between each agent and the centre of its subsystem, a novel distributed MPC strategy (Algorithm 1) is obtained with the exchange of current states only. Then, a reverse iterative algorithm (Algorithm 2) is specially designed for the receding horizon optimisation of sampled-data double-integrator dynamics. Illustrative examples are finally displayed to verify the effectiveness and advantage of the distributed MPC consensus strategy and the impact of sampling period on consensus."
